## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

Setting Up the Project
After cloning the project, navigate to the project folder and follow the steps below:

1. Install PHP Dependencies
First, install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

bash
Copy
Edit
composer install
2. Install JavaScript Dependencies
To install JavaScript dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Set Up the .env File
To set up the project, you need to configure your .env file. Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp .env.example .env
Then, set the necessary environment variables like DB_CONNECTION, APP_KEY, and other configurations.

4. Generate Application Key
To generate the application key, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan key:generate
5. Database Migrations
To create the database tables, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan migrate
6. Set Up Storage Symbolic Link
Since uploaded files are stored in the public directory of the storage folder, you need to create a symbolic link to make them accessible. Run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan storage:link
This command will create a symbolic link from public/storage to storage/app/public, allowing you to access the uploaded files through the public URL.

7. Run the Project
Once everything is set up, you can start the development server by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
php artisan serve
After running this command, you can access the project in your browser at http://localhost:8000.

Additional Notes
If you are using Windows, be sure to use XAMPP or WAMP to run PHP.
You can test the API using tools like Postman or Insomnia.
rust
Copy
Edit

This updated section includes instructions for setting up the symbolic link for storage, so uploaded files are properly linked and accessible.
